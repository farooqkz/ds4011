## Project details

### Introduction

The management of a park has requested you a system to manage their park. In this park there are game platforms and a buying queue in which customers enter to buy one or more tickets. Each game platform has a "capacity" which one cannot exceed and newer customers have to wait till the former ones finish playing and exist the platform.

### Buy procedure

There is a ticket counter from which customers can buy as many tickets as they want. And a queue in front of this window to which customers enter. To enter and exist the window, for each customer 5 seconds will be elasped plus 2 seconds for buying each ticket. For instance, acustomer takes 9 seconds to buy 2 tickets(5 + 2x2).

### Game platform

It must be possible in this system to define game platforms each with hese attributes:

 - Minimum capacity: The least which the game platform can run
 - Maximum capacity: The maximum number of customers which fit in the platform
 - Price: How much is a ticket for this platform?
 - Time: How much does it need for a full round of play?

To enter a platform or to exit it, 5 seconds will be elasped.
